# MalLang
**MalLang** is a beginner-friendly, Korean-based programming language designed to make coding as soft and intuitive as possible — just like its name, "말랑 (mallang)", meaning soft and squishy in Korean.
MalLang is built on top of Python as an interpreted language, tailored especially for educational environments. It aims to lower the barrier to entry for programming by using natural, readable Korean syntax that feels familiar to native speakers.
